# Project Structure Analysis

## Overview
Analysis of the project structure against the development standards outlined in `development_standards_and_project_goals.md`.

## Current Structure
```
historical-fidelity-simulator/
├── historical_fidelity_simulator/  # Main package directory
│   ├── simulator.py
│   ├── quantum/
│   ├── classical/
│   ├── utils/
│   ├── benchmarks/
│   └── analysis/
├── tests/
├── docs/
├── examples/
├── audit/
└── benchmarks/
```

## Deviations from Standards

1. **Directory Location**
   - ✗ Main package code is directly in `historical_fidelity_simulator/` instead of `src/`
   - ✗ Benchmarks appear in two locations (root and package directory)
   - ✓ Tests, docs, and examples follow standard structure

2. **Additional Components**
   - `analysis/` directory not in original spec but appears justified for separation of concerns
   - `audit/` directory added for project quality tracking (recommended to keep)

3. **Missing Components**
   - No explicit CI/CD configuration files
   - No CONTRIBUTING.md file
   - No CHANGELOG.md file

## Module Organization

1. **Core Components**
   - ✓ `simulator.py`: Implements core simulation framework
   - ✓ `quantum/`: Contains quantum-specific implementations
   - ✓ `classical/`: Contains classical physics implementations
   - ✓ `utils/`: Contains shared utilities

2. **Additional Components**
   - `analysis/`: Contains analysis tools and utilities
   - `benchmarks/`: Contains performance testing code

## Recommendations

1. **High Priority**
   - Move package code to `src/` directory to follow Python best practices
   - Consolidate benchmarks into single location
   - Add CI/CD configuration

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Add CONTRIBUTING.md with development guidelines
   - Add CHANGELOG.md to track version changes
   - Create .gitignore if not present

3. **Low Priority**
   - Consider reorganizing benchmarks and analysis modules
   - Add issue and PR templates
   - Add code owners file

## Impact Assessment

The current structure is functional but deviates from best practices in ways that could impact:
- Package distribution
- Development workflow
- Contribution process
- Long-term maintainability

## Next Steps

1. Create migration plan for src/ directory structure
2. Establish documentation for contribution workflow
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline
4. Consolidate benchmark locations
